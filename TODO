* 3.0

** implement new syntax (being done)

** implement a better packaging system allowing zipped source files with
XML package descriptions to be delivered and installed.  Investigate
basing it on the Virtual File System infrastructure.

** faster startup (done)

** restructure init/pre/kernel files (done)

** upgrade XML parser for package files
*** support arch-dependent files that are installed in the image path


* sometime

** some kind of sandboxing (partly done)

** add check in/check out to the browser so that .st files remain
in sync.  Maybe with CVS support (see Smalltalk/X).

** cute BlockClosure implementations

** port more software (Ref. Browser?)


----------------------------------------------------------------------


* bindings

** zlib.  use it to implement direct ZIP-file access in VFS.

** IPv6.  Not hard to do.

** rss.  would provide cool examples of XML.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* code auditing

** check endian-cleanness of ByteStream's float and double I/O.
Possibly fix by mutuating code from the Java package.

* VM

** create combined pop/push tree codes in the JIT compiler.  They're
still there from the old bytecode set and they should improve
performance by ~5%.

** Fix some copy & paste redundancies in comp.c (the small iteration
to find out the length of loops) and opt.c (basic block handling in
the verifier and in the JIT compiler's analysis pass).

** Use multiple malloc-ed areas for the OOP table, and make heap.c
only an implementation detail of alloc.c (not really necessary
anymore with MAP_NORESERVE, and quite complicated)

** Implement polymorphic inline caching


* Java

** Write more native methods.  Some, such as network methods, are
easy.  Reflection is hard especially for arrays.

** Pass exception in a temporary rather than in the top of the
stack; not very hard, and should make the JITter happy about
exceptions.


* Blox

** Use GTK.  Might or might not use libgnomeui for the canvas
widget.  I have already written a custom geometry manager compatible
with Tk's placer.

** Clean up the browser's code

*** remove stray sends of #initialize.  A good project to learn
about the reflection system (e.g. identify initializations from
outside #new and so on).

*** simplify UI creation (too many panes!)


* other

** follow the implementation lines of compiler/STLoader.st to implement
SIF file-in.

** make the smalltalk cpp work - nothing less, nothing more ;-)

** print entities correctly in the URIResolver.  A file named abc&def
should print abc&amp;def in the file list.


* emacs mode

** emacs isearch c-u c-s should search for a string anchored at the start of
a line, to help finding method definitions.

** fix $. to be handled specially -- indenter gets confused on 
   ch == $.
      <here>ifTrue: 

** fix emacs mode so when a compile error occurs, it can be scanned ala C-x`

** indent correctly ! at beginning of line
